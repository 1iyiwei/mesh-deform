## mesh-deform
**mesh-deform** is cross-platform C++11 library capable of deforming meshes under rigidity constraints, leading to an interactive visually appealing (not necessarily physically correct) surface modeling approach.

The implementation is based on *Sorkine, Olga, and Marc Alexa. "As-rigid-as-possible surface modeling." Symposium on Geometry processing. Vol. 4. 2007.*
